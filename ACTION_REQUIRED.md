# ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED: Check Your Database

## 🔴 Critical: Your Issue is Likely Database Migration

I've fixed the code, but **you need to check if your database has the `game_number` column**.

---

## 🎯 What I Fixed

1. ✅ Added `game_number` to TypeScript types
2. ✅ Removed `created_at` from profitRow (was causing issues)
3. ✅ Rebuilt and synced Android app

---

## 🚨 What YOU Need to Do

### Step 1: Check Your Database (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://tglohosjdjqmonnlvawe.supabase.co
2. Click **"Table Editor"**
3. Select **`game_profits`** table
4. **Do you see a column called `game_number`?**
   - ✅ **YES** → Go to Step 4
   - ❌ **NO** → Go to Step 2

---

### Step 2: Run Migration (if game_number missing)

1. In Supabase, click **"SQL Editor"**
2. Click **"New Query"**
3. Copy/paste this:

```sql
-- Add game_number column
DO $$ BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns 
        WHERE table_name = 'game_profits' 
        AND column_name = 'game_number'
    ) THEN
        ALTER TABLE public.game_profits 
        ADD COLUMN game_number integer;
    END IF;
END $$;

-- Populate existing data
UPDATE public.game_profits gp
SET game_number = g.game_number
FROM public.games g
WHERE gp.game_id = g.id
AND gp.game_number IS NULL;

-- Make required
ALTER TABLE public.game_profits 
ALTER COLUMN game_number SET NOT NULL;
```

4. Click **"Run"**
5. Wait for success

---

### Step 3: Verify Migration

Run this query:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'game_profits' 
AND column_name = 'game_number';
```

You should see: `game_number | integer`

---

### Step 4: Rebuild Android

```bash
npm run android
```

Then run in Android Studio.

---

### Step 5: Test

1. Create/join a table
2. Start Game 1, save end-ups
3. Start Game 2, save end-ups
4. **Should work now!**

---

## 📝 Why This Matters

**Your database URL:** `https://tglohosjdjqmonnlvawe.supabase.co`

The code is trying to save `game_number`, but if the column doesn't exist in your database, it will fail silently or error.

---

## ❓ Quick Check

**Answer this:** When you look at the `game_profits` table in Supabase, do you see `game_number` column?

- **If YES** → Just rebuild with `npm run android` and test
- **If NO** → Run the SQL migration in Step 2

**Most likely issue:** Database migration not applied. Check now! 🚀
