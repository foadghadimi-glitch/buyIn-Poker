# 🧪 TEST THIS NOW: Android End-Up Fix

## ✅ Fix is Applied!

The Android app bug has been fixed. The issue was that TypeScript types were missing the `game_number` field.

## 🧪 Testing Steps

**In Android Studio:**

1. **Make sure your changes are synced** (already done for you):
   ```bash
   npm run build && npm run cap:sync  # Already completed ✓
   ```

2. **Run the app:**
   - Open Android Studio with your project
   - Click the green **▶️ Play** button
   - Or press `Cmd+R` (Mac) / `Ctrl+R` (Windows)

3. **Test the fix:**
   - Create or join a poker table
   - Add some buy-ins for players
   - Click "End Game" → enter end-up values → Save
   - **✅ Game 1 should save correctly**
   - Click "Start New Game" 
   - Add more buy-ins
   - Click "End Game" → enter end-up values → Save
   - **✅ Game 2 should now save correctly!**

4. **Verify in Summary:**
   - Click the "Summary" button
   - You should see profits for both Game 1 and Game 2
   - Each player should have two rows of data

## ✅ Expected Results

**Before Fix:** ❌ Game 2 data would not save or would be incorrect

**After Fix:** ✅ Both Game 1 and Game 2 save correctly with proper game numbers

## 🐛 What Was Fixed

The `game_profits` table type was missing the `game_number` field. Android's stricter TypeScript compilation was filtering out this field when saving end-up data.

**File changed:** `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`

## 📝 If It Still Doesn't Work

1. Make sure you rebuilt the app:
   ```bash
   npm run build && npm run cap:sync
   ```

2. Check Android Studio console for any errors

3. Try uninstalling and reinstalling the app on your device/emulator

4. Verify you're testing with a fresh table (or clear old data)
