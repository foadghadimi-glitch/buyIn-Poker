## 🎯 Next Steps (Choose One)

### Option 1: Quick Start (Already Done!)
I've already opened the project in Android Studio for you. If Android Studio is open:
1. Wait for Gradle to finish syncing (bottom status bar)
2. Click the green **▶️ Play** button at the top
3. Select a device or create an emulator
4. Your app will build and run!

### Option 2: If Android Studio Didn't Open
Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
npm run cap:open:android
```

## 📁 Folder Structure

You now have ONE main folder to work with:

```
buyin-blitz/
├── android/          ← THIS IS YOUR ANDROID APP (open this in Android Studio)
├── src/              ← Your React source code
├── dist/             ← Built web app
└── package.json      ← Project configuration
```

The confusing `mobile/` folder has been removed!

## 🔄 Daily Development Workflow

When you make changes to your React code:

```bash
# 1. Build the web app
npm run build

# 2. Sync to Android
npm run cap:sync

# 3. In Android Studio, click the Run button again
```
