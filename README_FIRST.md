This document explains the **one most important thing** about working with this Android app.

## 🎯 The ONE Thing You Need to Know

You must manually sync changes.

## ✅ The Solution: One Simple Command

**After making ANY code changes, run:**

```bash
npm run android
```

That's it! Then in Android Studio, just click Run.

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: What is `npm run android`?**  
A: It builds your web app and copies it to the Android project.

**Q: Why isn't it automatic?**  
A: Because you need to control when to sync (avoid syncing broken builds).

**Q: How often do I need to run it?**  
A: Every time you make code changes and want to test on Android.

**Q: Can I test without Android Studio?**  
A: Yes! Run `npm run dev` for browser testing (faster for development).
